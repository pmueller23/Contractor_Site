      <h2>Radon is a cancer-causing, radioactive gas</h2>
      <p>
        You can't see radon. You can't smell radon. You can't taste radon. But
        radon may be a problem in your home. Radon causes thousands of deaths
        each year. The Surgeon General has warned that radon is the second
        leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. Only smoking causes
        more lung cancer deaths.

      <h2>Radon can be found all over the U.S.</h2>
      <p>
        Radon comes from the natural (radioactive) breakdown of uranium in soil,
        rock, and water and gets into the air you breathe. Radon can be found all
        over the U.S. and can get into any type of building â€” homes, offices, and
        schools. You and your family are most likely to get your greatest
        exposure at home, where you spend most of your time.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>You should test for radon</h2>
      <p>
        Testing is the only way to know if you and your family are at risk from
        radon. The EPA and the Surgeon General recommend testing all homes.
        Testing is inexpensive and easy. It will only take a few minutes of your
        time.

      <h2>You can fix a radon problem</h2>
      <p>
        Radon reduction systems work and they are not too costly. Some radon
        reduction systems can reduce radon levels in your home by up to 99%.
        Even very high levels can be reduced to acceptable levels.

      <h2>How does radon get into your home?</h2>
      <p>
        Radon is a radioactive gas. It comes from the natural decay of uranium
        that is found in nearly all soils. It typically moves up through the
        ground and into your home through cracks and other holes in the
        foundation. Your home traps radon inside where it can build up. Any home
        may have a radon problem. This means new and old homes, well-sealed and
        drafty homes, and homes with or without basements.

      <h2>Test Today</h2>
      <p>
        Nearly 1 out of every 15 homes in the U.S. is estimated to have elevated
        radon levels. Elevated levels of radon gas have been found in homes in
        Fresno, Clovis, surrounding San Joaquin Valley homes, and in homes in the
        Sierra Mountains. While radon problems may be more common in some areas,
        any home may have a problem. The only way to know about your home is to
        test.

      <p>
        Testing is the only way to know if you and your family are at risk from
        radon. Testing is inexpensive and easy. The EPA and the Surgeon General
        recommend that you test your home for radon. Millions of Americans have
        already tested their homes for radon. Keep yourself and your family safe.
        Test today.

      <h2>The testing process</h2>
      <p>
        Testing your home for radon is easy. Simply call us and book an
        appointment. The appointment will take place at your house. One of our
        technicians will come to your home and install testing equipment. The
        equipment is small and quiet. The equipment will be placed in an
        unobtrusive location. Setting up the equipment only takes a few minutes.
        After two days, our technician will come back to your house, pick up the
        equipment, interpret your results, answer questions, and provide
        solutions.

      <h2>Testing fees</h2>
      <p>
        Testing your home for radon is very affordable. The fee for testing is
        normally $250 but we are offering a special promotion through the end of
        the month which offers testing for only $99.

      <h2>Radon measurement</h2>
      <p>
        Radon is measured in picocuries per liter (pCi/L). If your radon level is
        4 pCi/L or higher, the EPA and the Surgeon General recommend that you fix
        your home. Radon levels less than 4 pCi/L still poses a risk which, in
        many cases, may be reduced. The EPA believes that any radon exposure
        carries risk - no level of radon is safe. Even radon levels below 4 pCi/L
        pose some risk, and you can reduce your risk of lung cancer by lowering
        your radon level.
      </p>
      <p>
        The average indoor radon level is estimated to be about 1.3 pCi/L. About
        0.4 pCi/L of radon is normally found in the outside air. The U.S. Congress
        has set a long-term goal that indoor radon levels be no more than outdoor
        levels. While this goal is not yet achievable in all cases, most homes
        today can be reduced to 2 pCi/L or below.

      <h2>Radon and selling your home</h2>
      <p>
        More home buyers and renters are asking about radon levels before they
        buy or rent a home. Because real estate sales happen quickly, there is
        often little time to deal with radon and other issues. The best thing to
        do is to test for radon now and save the results so that you may share
        them with the buyer. If your home has elevated radon levels, fix the
        problem now so that it won't complicate your home sale.

      <h2>How to lower radon levels in your home</h2>
      <p>
        There is no known safe level of radon. You can reduce your risk by
        decreasing radon levels in your home.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several proven methods to reduce radon in your home. The method
        primarily used is a vent pipe and fan, which pulls radon from beneath the
        house and vents it to the outside. This system, known as a soil suction
        radon reduction system, does not require major changes to your home.
        Sealing foundation cracks and other openings makes this kind of system
        more effective and cost-efficient. Similar systems can be installed in
        houses with crawl spaces. Our licensed contractors might use other methods.
        The right system depends on the design of your home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lowering high radon levels requires technical knowledge and special skills.
        Our contractors are licensed and trained to fix radon problems. We will
        study the radon problem in your home and find the best solution for
        lowering radon levels in your home.
      </p>
      <p>
        After we have installed a system for lowering radon levels in your home,
        we will test your home again to ensure that radon levels have been reduced
        to a safe level. Our soil suction radon reduction systems also include a
        monitor that will indicate whether the system is operating properly.

      <h2>Radon and home renovations</h2>
      <p>
        If you are planning a remodel, it is important to test the area for radon
        before you begin. If you have elevated radon levels, radon-resistant
        techniques can be inexpensively included as part of the remodel. Because
        major renovations can change the level of radon in any home, always test
        again after work is completed. Contact us so that we may help you make
        your home a safe and healthy place to live.

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <article>
      <h2>Our company, our family</h2>
      <p>
        We are a local, family-run business. We began this business because we
        became aware of the cancer-causing hazard that radon poses. After our son
        was born, I learned that children are particularly susceptible to the
        negative health impacts of radon. At the time there was no local business
        that provided radon testing or mitigation. In order to keep our family
        safe, we educated ourselves. We learned how to test for radon and how to
        reduce radon levels. The first radon mitigation system we installed was
        in our home. I am happy that our home is now free from the unnecessary
        danger of hazardously high radon levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Helping people stay safe, helping people protect their families, and
        helping people avoid cancer is what our business is all about. As we
        talked to friends and family about radon, we realized there are many
        people who can benefit from what we have learned. We partnered with our
        cousin who is a licensed general contractor and our business was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to help people stay healthy so that they can live and enjoy
        their lives.
